    "SQLAlchemy is a powerful Object Relational Mapper that lets us \"map\" our Python objects to SQL database tables.  Generally, each of our Python classes will have its own table in our database and each new instance of a class gets \"mapped\" to a row on one of these tables.  As we are probably well aware by now, writing SQL inserts, updates, and queries can be a repetitive and tedious process.  SQLAlchemy has a library of built-in methods that handle these tasks in a simple and easy manner.  In this lab, we will use SQLAlchemy to create a new database and create a table."
